# Mini PQC Scanner

#  Please note that this project is a fork and is intended for learning Post-Quantum Cryptography. The inventory information will be updated for the Windows operating system.



## The Quantum Threat is Real - Are You Ready?

Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) represents the next evolution in cybersecurity, designed to protect against the imminent threat of quantum computers that will render current encryption methods obsolete. With quantum computers advancing rapidly and NIST standardizing PQC algorithms in 2024, organizations must act **now** to assess and upgrade their cryptographic infrastructure.

**Why PQC Matters:**
- **Quantum computers will break RSA, ECDSA, and ECDH** - the foundation of today's internet security
- **"Harvest now, decrypt later" attacks** are already happening - adversaries are collecting encrypted data today to decrypt once quantum computers are available
- **NIST has standardized PQC algorithms** (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA) - the migration window is closing
- **Regulatory compliance** requirements are emerging globally for quantum-safe cryptography

Mini PQC Scanner is a streamlined, command-line tool that helps organizations assess their quantum readiness by scanning systems, services, and cryptographic implementations. This lightweight version focuses on core scanning functionality, making it perfect for automated assessments, CI/CD integration, and rapid security audits.

**Enterprise Solutions:** For comprehensive PQC migration planning, automated remediation, and enterprise-grade reporting, explore our full PQC platform at [quantumcrafts.ai](https://quantumcrafts.ai). Our enterprise version includes advanced features like automated certificate management, policy enforcement, compliance reporting, and guided migration workflows.

```

This will prompt for:
- Organization name
- License key (if applicable)
- Other scanner settings

### JSON Output
Machine-readable format for automation:

```bash
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner env -json
```

## Examples

### Basic System Scan
```bash
# Quick environment check
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner env

# Check kernel PQC support
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner kernel

# Analyze certificates
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner parsecrt -verbose
```

### Comprehensive Assessment
```bash
# Run all modules with JSON output
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner all -json > pqc-report.json

# Test specific service
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner openssh
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner nginx
```

### Network Analysis
```bash
# Test TLS configuration
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner tls example.com

# Check tcpdump capabilities and PQC readiness
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner tcpdump

# Capture network traffic (requires sudo)
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner tcpdump -dump

# Parse captured traffic from default location
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner tcpdump -parse

# Parse specific capture file
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner tcpdump -parse -f /path/to/capture.pcap

# List available network interfaces
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner tcpdump -list
```

### tcpdump Module Details

The tcpdump module provides network traffic analysis for PQC readiness assessment:

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Check tcpdump installation and capabilities
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner tcpdump
```
This command:
- Verifies tcpdump and tshark installation
- Checks protocol support (TLS, SSH, IPsec, QUIC)
- Reports version information
- Identifies missing PQC-relevant capabilities

#### Traffic Capture
```bash
# Capture network traffic (requires sudo privileges)
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner tcpdump -dump
```
This command:
- Captures encrypted traffic for 30 seconds by default
- Monitors ports: 443, 8443, 22, 500, 4500, 51820, 25, 465, 587, 993, 995
- Saves capture to `./dump/` directory with timestamp
- Limits file size to 1MB maximum
- Requires sudo access for packet capture

**Note**: To avoid sudo prompts, run:
```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip $(which tcpdump)
```

#### Traffic Analysis
```bash
# Parse most recent capture file
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner tcpdump -parse

# Parse specific capture file
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner tcpdump -parse -f /path/to/capture.pcap
```
This command:
- Analyzes TLS handshakes for PQC readiness
- Identifies non-quantum-resistant algorithms
- Reports cipher suites and key exchange methods
- Provides recommendations for PQC migration

#### Advanced Options
```bash
# List network interfaces
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner tcpdump -list

# Extended capture with process tracking (if BCC tools installed)
./bin/mini-pqc-scanner tcpdump -dump -process-track -s 60
```
